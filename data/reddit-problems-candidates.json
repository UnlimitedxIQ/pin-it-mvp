They\u2019ll give you something messy and see how you clarify scope, handle constraints, and respond when engineering pushes back. For APM they\u2019re not looking for brilliance, they\u2019re looking for structure and humility. Big tip: slow down. Restate the problem, ask what success looks like, surface tradeoffs out loud. Don\u2019t try to impress with jargon. Show you can think clearly and collaborate. Also given you\u2019ve been searching 7 months, take it. Worst case it\u2019s high quality reps. Best case you land something and stabilize.",

        "text": "There's not enough information. Sales using a different crm than marketing is a red flag. Are the leads garbage? Is the sales team garbage? Are there consistent processes? Is there a solid automation setup between CRMs? What's the average response time to MQLs? There's another poster saying he fired the marketing team and hired meeting setters. I call bullshit, but regardless, most CEOs don't give a shit about any number that isn't revenue generating. The farther down attribution goes the more lost the CEO is on impact you generated in that revenue. If the MQL is event stage 3 but sale is after event stage 30, you will have a hard time selling the CEO that you had impact in that sale. Get used to fighting for your value. We talk about cost for acquisition, cost for MQL vs SQL, cost for this cost for that because CFOs run modern marketing and sales teams, not CEOs. And that's why so many companies fail. Advertising days were simple. Spend $50,000 on a billboard and generate $150,000 in new revenue. You just made a $100,000 profit from the advertising department. That's easy for a CEO to ignore the CFO when he says \"well you don't know if they would have come in without the billboard. Maybe if we cut billboards they'll come in anyway\". Attribution has become so convoluted for most companies and everyone fights for who \"sold\" the lead that the CEO cant extrapolate on if marketing had any impact in generating that revenue from the CFO. So you get cut and nobody respects you thinking you provide tiktok dances.",

        "text": "There is already a lot of good advice above, so I\u2019ll just add a two key points. First, it sounds like there\u2019s a significant misalignment between marketing and sales. You need a clear, shared definition of what counts as a marketing-qualified lead versus a sales-qualified lead. Once both sides agree and buy into that definition, it becomes much harder to argue over lead quality and it reduces ambiguity substantially. Second, I\u2019m consistently surprised by how many marketers have little real understanding of sales. A strong marketer spends time with the sales team, observes the full sales cycle, listens to customer objections, and understands the emotional impact the product or service has on the customer. You will not learn that by staying in the office. You have to be in the field with sales. This is actually something I have used as a screening criterion when hiring for marketing roles. I ask how they interact with customers and how closely they work with the sales team. I want the marketer who stands with the sales team at the point of display if it\u2019s a product, or sits in on pitches and listens to real conversations if its services. That is how you learn how to market effectively to those customers. If a marketer is not doing that, then they are essentially marketing in the blind.",
