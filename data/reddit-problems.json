A 30 or 60 day late payment is damaging but it's the 90 day one that really gets you, and you're correct it will take 7 years (same length as bankruptcy) to fully recover. Source: happened to me. Best you can do is never make a late payment again, put as much distance between this and the time you'll need to utilize your credit as you can, and then hope you can find an understanding lender when it comes time. Beyond that, how's your wife's credit? Fortunately my husband's credit is immaculate and we were still able to buy a house at the tail end of \"my\" 7 years with a competitive interest rate.",

        "text": "&gt; My bank closed down in October (like it went bankrupt and closed). There were only two bank failures in 2025 and both in the first half of the year. Moreover, when a bank fails, the FDIC typically makes great efforts to try to keep payments processing as usual. Furthermore, how could it be only one missed payment and 90 days late? If you have a payment due every month, and one payment is report 90d late, that means you have missed three to four payments. I am not surprised at all they would not do a goodwill reversal, and secondly, if they openly told you to send a letter, it sounds like they did not even refuse -- you just haven't bothered to send it. Anyway, the credit scoring people have basically decided that a 90d late is catastrophic -- in rough terms, there's basically a 50/50 as to whether it ever gets paid at that point. 30d lates and 60/90d lates are treated very differently. You will see the the list of score reason codes, \"serious delinquency\" used in the reason code. And FICO scoring is a lot more complex than the simple pie chart of score factors they show, but in any case, the impact will get better over time, potentially with a significant recalculation at 2 years out.",

B2C absolutely has its own problems: attention is expensive, churn is brutal, and yes, competing with free apps backed by billions in VC money is a nightmare. But it also has lower barriers to entry and can scale in ways B2B often can't without a sales team. The real lesson isn't \"B2B good, B2C bad.\" It's do your market research before you build anything. Talk to potential customers. Test demand. Look at whether people are already paying for solutions in that space. If you've been building for a year and nobody's biting, that's not a B2C problem; That's a market fit problem. Some of the biggest successes I've seen started B2B and pivoted to B2C, or the other way around. The model isn't the point. Understanding who will pay you and why is the point.",
